# asterotoken


*Purpose of the project*
Asterotoken has been conceived at ETH San Francisco Hackathon on 5th October 2018.

We want to join others such as Elon Musk who are striving to make humans interplanetary species.
We think a realistic way to bring this date closer is to boost space exploration through making it economically attractive.
Asteroid mining is going to be a thing 10-20 years from now.

Problem is that currently researchers have very limited sources of public/government funding. Only very few selected missions get funded on annnual basis.

Unlocking commerical market and private funding for these missions can increase their volume by hundreds. This will significantly step up the pace of human space exploration.

The goal of this project is to build a platform and ecosystem connnecting researchers / mission plannners, investors, operators (companies actually flying spaceships, drilling and extracting) as well as insurers, bankers, auditors, commodity brokers and other relevant participants.
